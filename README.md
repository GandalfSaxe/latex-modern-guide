This is work-in-progress mega note on LaTeX packages, especially using [Typora](http://typora.io) and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) with LaTeX in mind.

Recommended way to view right now: In [Typora](http://typora.io).

TODO: Include some sort of table of contents for better navigation outside of using Typora.
